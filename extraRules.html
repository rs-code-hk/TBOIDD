        <h1>Extra Rules</h1>
        <p>
            This homebrew adds some new rules to make these items work. 
            If an item seems like it would break, or item interactions aren't listed, check here.

        <h3>Multipliers</h3>
        <p>
            There are 2 types of multipliers, positive multipliers and negative multipliers.
            Positive multipliers are any multipliers above 1*.
            Negative multipliers are any multipliers below 1*.
            You can only have one of each,
            your highest positive multiplier, and lowest negative multiplier.
            If you have both, multiply them together and there's you're multiplier.
            For example, if you have a 1.5* and 2.0* multiplier, use the 2.0* multiplier.
            If you have a 0.3* multiplier, and a 0.2* multiplier, use the 0.2* multiplier.
            If you have a 0.2* multiplier and a 2.0* multiplier, 0.2 * 2.0 = 0.4* multiplier.
