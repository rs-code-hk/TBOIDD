        <h1>Extra Rules</h1>
        <p>
            This homebrew adds some new rules to make these items work. 
            If an item seems like it would break, or item interactions aren't listed, check here.

        <h3>Multipliers</h3>
        <p>
            There are 2 types of multipliers, positive multipliers and negative multipliers.
            Positive multipliers are any multipliers above 1*.
            Negative multipliers are any multipliers below 1*.
            You can only have one of each,
            your highest positive multiplier, and lowest negative multiplier.
            If you have both, multiply them together and there's you're multiplier.
